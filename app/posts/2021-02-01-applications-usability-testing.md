The discovery research conducted in October 2020 highlighted the benefits of providing a standardised application form for teachers to apply for jobs listed in Teaching vacancies. Having a single application format would make it easier for jobseekers to apply for those jobs as they wouldn’t have to fill applications that came not only in a variety of formats but also asked different questions, which are current pain points for teachers. 

Given the above, a basic Google forms application was created to explore the landscape with teachers and from there a more detailed prototype was developed and tested, giving rise to a second prototype which was also tested with teachers during round 3, in order to refine the application process from the jobseeker’s point of view. 

## User needs

User needs around applications for jobseekers and hiring staff can be found in the [User needs/ Hypothesis master](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c0S0OZTgpRBlStgBBX79WJ7P07i-3F9VODIKSO5qkxM/edit#gid=877107711).

## Who we tested with

* round 1: 5 jobseekers (teachers) recruited by Criteria
* round 2: 5 jobseekers (teachers) recruited by Criteria
* round 3: 5 jobseekers (teachers) recruited by Criteria

## What we learned

Listed below are the main findings. Full details can be found in the playback decks.

Users expect to create an account to apply for a job.

> “I would expect to create an account to apply, but sometimes it asks me to link it to my Facebook account which is weird.”

Users don’t understand the term ‘Quick apply’.

> “I’ve seen it on eTeach, maybe it's a way of registering interest?”.

Teachers are positive about applying through a DfE service.

> “I would be more comfortable with applying through a DfE service because it feels more official. You expect that all the safeguarding things are in check, etc.”

On the application teachers expect to include their education and qualifications and other professional qualifications.

> “I would want to put my first aid on there and various other trainings. I would probably put it separately from this (Education and qualifications) and I would imagine that we would go on to that.”

On ‘Professional status’ users expect to be asked a clear and precise question e.g. _“Have you completed your NQT year?”_

Users don’t fully understand what it’s meant by the question around ‘Relevant organisation membership’. They don’t know what exactly we are asking and some thought it has to do with them belonging to a union, which they felt shouldn’t be asked.

> “Does this mean unions? If that was the case I would leave this blank.”

When it comes to requesting where a user worked, the word ‘Organisation’ was not clear enough.

> “For organisation, do you mean school or the council?”

Some users (not all) wanted guidance to write their personal statement.

> “I would say - rather than 'you may find it useful', in the politest way possible, you should tell them they should. People do need to work it out for themselves, but you should say that they should refer to the job/person specification. You might want to say how long it should be because the employer isn't going to want to read loads of long applications. Could be a small bit of guidance that it could be around 1-2 A4 pages.”

To feel confident in submitting their application and that it has been received by the school, applicants need to review their application and receive a submission confirmation.

> “I would expect a 'thank you for your application' or similar. I remember once I panicked and submitted the application 3 times because it just took me back to the homepage. A copy of the application underneath would be nice, so you can go through and check everything before you click submit.”

## Next steps

Determine the application MVP version for jobseekers (in conjunction with application management piece for hiring staff) based on findings. Develop MVP version and move into production.




Task 1: Interview
Task 2: Create a job listing for a Teaching Assistant
Task 3: Receive an application
Task 4: Closing Interview

## Hypotheses

* Expanding the scope to TAs may support the Department’s goals to support schools in COVID and Recovery
* Teaching assistant roles are relatively similar to teacher roles, therefore it is not required to make fundamental changes to the service for hiring staff to be able to list teaching assistants roles on the service
* Hiring staff have an understanding of what school tutors are
* Tutor roles are relatively similar to TA roles and therefore we do not need to make fundamental changes to the service for hiring staff to be able to list tutor roles on the service
* Hiring staff would use Teaching Vacancies to list teaching assistants roles if the scope was expanded
* Expanding the scope of the service to include TAs and tutor roles won’t stop schools/ trusts from listing job vacancies on other job boards

## What we learned

Key things we took away from this piece of research include:

TAs fall under support staff. By expanding the scope to TAs alone, we are naturally encouraging hiring staff to list other support roles.

> Only a small number of changes are required to adjust the current listing process and application form to suit TAs. Having said that, only 2 of the participants we spoke with would consider using the Teaching Vacancies application feature once all support roles could be listed.

Recruitment of TAs is different to that of teachers. TAs are mainly sourced through the local community (word of mouth, school alumni etc) or through agencies when there is an immediate demand.

> "The thing about teaching assistants as well is that because it's a lower pay grade, they normally come from the local area so you're not going to advertise for a TA"

There are concerns over the ‘Teaching Vacancies’ brand being too teacher orientated. Hiring staff lack confidence jobseekers will look at our service for these roles.

> "It's DfE teaching vacancies not education jobs, so you are sort of restricted on that name”

## Design notes

The hypothesis ‘we would not need to make fundamental changes to the service for hiring staff to be able to list teaching assistants roles on the service’ was valid. However, there were a few areas within the design of the listing process that would need to be considered.

### Job details

* users felt there wasn’t a suitable option under the job role
* users specified that TA roles are listed as term time only, an option we do not currently have under working pattern / contract type
* users felt there wasn’t a suitable option under subject
* suitable for NQTs was not always required for this type of role

  }
}) }}

### Pay package

Users felt it was important for this type of role to specify actual earnings, with a pro-rata / FTE option to make this clear.

  }
}) }}

### Application form

* TRN, QTS and induction year were not requirements for this type of role
* users wanted to see barred declarations on the application form

    file: "application-form.png",
    alt: "The application form once submitted to hiring staff"
  }
}) }}


## Next steps 

### Research with jobseekers in educational support roles

* How are jobseekers currently searching and applying for educational support staff roles?
* How might we need to adapt our service to meet their needs?

### More research with hiring staff

* Dig deeper into schools’ feelings and motivations towards listing all support roles once we are ready to test pilot designs
