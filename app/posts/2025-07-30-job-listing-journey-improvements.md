Following the improvements to [allow hiring staff to list all school roles](/allowing-hiring-staff-to-list-support-roles-on-the-service/) in March 2024, we reviewed elements of our job listing journey to ensure this was inclusive to the new role types that had been introduced during the scope expansion.  

## Key findings
  
User research highlighted a need for more flexibility when advertising certain roles, such as exam invigilators, particularly when it came to choosing the contract type and salary, due to the ad hoc nature of the role.  

Hiring staff were not clear on how to list roles that did not have a specific category on the ‘What type of job is this?’ page. This page came first in the job listing journey, followed by the job title page, and meant that hiring staff thought certain roles were not able to be listed on the service if they were not shown on this initial page.

## Additional insights 

Following an internal review, we also noticed: 

- a large portion of the start date entries given by hiring staff in the ‘Other’ category were ‘ASAP’, ‘As soon as possible’, ‘Immediate start’ or similar phrases 
- of our working patterns, only ‘full time’ and ‘part time’ were being used and the ‘flexible’, ‘job share’, or term time options were not used  

## What we have done  

The changes made following user feedback and internal analysis are: 

- adding an ‘As soon as possible’ start date option within the job listing journey 
- swapped the first two pages of the job listing journey, so the first page is now the ‘Job title’ page followed by the ‘What type of job is this?’ page 
- updating the working patterns page to remove flexible and term time options and changing the job share option to be a yes or no response  
- adding a casual contract type option to the contracts page 
- adding an hourly pay option to the salary and allowances page  

These changes should allow hiring staff to accurately represent all roles on the service and complete the job listing journey more easily.
