To make the Teaching Vacancies savings figure methodology more widely accessible, we published it in September 2024.

We also published a vision statement to clarify service eligibility and define our approach to accepting integrations with applicant tracking systems (ATS).

## What we have done
  
We have added two links to the Teaching Vacancies footer for: 
 
- a <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/pages/savings-methodology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">savings methodology (opens in new tab)</a> page (September 2024) 
- a <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/pages/vision-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vision statement (opens in new tab)</a> page (February 2025)
