To share the Teaching Vacancies' savings figure methodology more widely, we needed to publish our methodology. This was completed in September 2024.  

We also wanted to provide a vision statement to improve the clarity on the service eligibility and our ability to accept integrations with applicant tracking systems (ATS).  

## What we have done
  
We have added two links to the Teaching Vacancies footer for: 
 
- a <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/pages/savings-methodology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">savings methodology (opens in new tab)</a> page (September 2024) 
- a <a href="https://teaching-vacancies.service.gov.uk/pages/vision-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vision statement (opens in new tab)</a> page (February 2025)
