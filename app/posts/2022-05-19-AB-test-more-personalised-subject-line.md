title: 'A/B test: more personalised subject lines on job alert emails'
description: Subject line variant 2* was implemented because it generated a higher click-through rate (CTR) to a vacancy from the job alert emails.

*variant 2:
- "[School name] is hiring for a [job title] - and [number of new jobs minus 1] other new jobs"  
- example: Lambeth Academy is hiring for a Maths Teacher - and 4 other new jobs

## Introduction

We ran this A/B test to see whether different, more personalised subject lines would encourage more jobseekers to click through to vacancies from their job alert emails. We tested five variants against the current subject line for job alert emails, making six variants in total. We also measured how relevant the job listings were to jobseekers.


## Hypothesis

IF job alert emails have a more personalised subject line THEN more jobseekers will open their job alert email and click through to the vacancies within.


## Variants

Present version: 'Your job alert from Teaching Vacancies'
Variant 1:  [Job title] at [School] and [number of new jobs minus 1] other new jobs
- eg Maths Teacher at Lambeth Academy and 4 other new jobs
Variant 2:  [School name] is hiring for a [job title] - and [number of new jobs minus 1] other new jobs
- eg Lambeth Academy is hiring for a Maths Teacher - and 4 other new jobs
Variant 3:  Your job alert for [keywords]
- eg Your job alert for Mathematics
Variant 4:  [Number of new jobs] new jobs match your criteria
- eg 6 new jobs match your criteria
Variant 5: Your job alert: [Number of new jobs] new jobs match your criteria
- eg Your job alert: 6 new jobs match your criteria


## Who we tested with

We tested with 127,231 jobseekers between 27th January and 11th March 2022. 1/6th of users who receive job alerts were assigned each variant. 


## Findings

More personalised subject lines do increase the CTR to a vacancy from a job alert email
- all variants had a higher CTR than the present subject line, for which the CTR was 7.58%
- variants 1, 2 and 4 were significantly different to the present subject line at the 80% confidence level
Variant 2 had the highest CTR at 8.17%
- this was significantly different to the present subject line at the 95% confidence level
- however, there was insufficient data to show that variant 2 generated a higher CTR than variants 1 and 4, even at the 80% confidence level
A higher CTR does not always guarantee that results seem more relevant to the jobseeker
- we measured the document download rate (DDR) - the proportion of users who were sent a job alert with a particular variant who then went on to download the documents on a job listing - as an indicator of how relevant the results were to users
- with a higher CTR, we would have expected to see a higher DDR
- variant 2 had the second-highest DDR and variant 4 had the highest 
  > however, there was insufficient data to show a significant difference or similarity between the two, even at the 80% confidence level
- This was unexpected because the results the jobseekers saw were not changed - the only difference was the subject line of the job alert email sent to them 
  > One explanation for this could be that the subject line influenced the behaviour of jobseekers, and how they continued to engage with the listings

## Next steps

Based on these findings we decided to use variant 2 for all job alert emails. This is because it generated the highest CTR to a vacancy and results still appeared relevant to jobseekers, and certainly more so than the present subject line.
