{% from "figure/macro.njk" import appFigure with context %}

As it stands, our live application feature is not being widely used by schools and only provides hiring staff with a fairly limited set of features to assist with their recruitment process. For this next round of research on the application journey, our aim was to be [more ambitious with our prototype](/application-management/) and think bigger for future development in an attempt to better support that complete end to end process.


## Goals for the study

We aimed to usability test multiple new features on the hiring staff tracking system to verify that it meets their needs. New features included:
* downloading and sharing applications
* inviting an applicant to interview
* making decisions on an application
* contacting an applicant through the service
* making notes on an application

We also aimed to build a better understanding of the end to end recruitment process across Local Authority (LA) maintained schools, Multi Academy Trusts (MATs) and Single Academy Trusts (SATs) and better understand who would be responsible for implementing something like Teaching Vacancies (TV) into that process.

## What we tested
12 remote 1 hour sessions were carried out using Lookback.

This was an exploratory usability test. We wanted to give hiring staff free reign of the prototype to see how they would use TV upon receiving applications through the service.

We followed a discussion guide to ensure any questions asked were consistent.

## User needs

**As a hiring staff user**

I need:

*  to manage my applications in an efficient way so that I can reduce the time I spend on the recruitment process.
* to share the applications I receive with the shortlisting panel so that they can start the shortlisting process.
*  to inform the shortlisted candidates of the interview details so that they know when they have to come in and what is expected of them.
* to notify unsuccessful candidates that they haven’t been appointed so that they know they didn’t get the position.
* to notify the successful candidate they have been appointed so that they can decide if they want to accept the offer.

## Who we tested with

We spoke with 12 hiring staff within in-scope, state funded schools and trusts in England. Amongst the 12 participants there were:
* 6 primary schools
* 6 secondary schools
* a mixture of MATs / SATs & LA maintained schools

9 out of the 12 participants were first time users of TV. All were first time users of the TV applicant tracking system (ATS).

## Our Assumptions

Our aim was to validate the following assumptions.

**Downloading and sharing applications**

* We believe some hiring staff can be selective over the applications they share with the panel.
* We believe hiring staff would rather pass the applications they receive straight on to the panel than have to download them first.
* We believe members of the shortlisting panel are more likely to check applications via email than log in to a system like Teaching Vacancies to view them.

**Scheduling interviews**

* We believe hiring staff sometimes need to make changes to or cancel interviews that have been scheduled.
* We believe having one place to set up interviews and correspond with candidates about their interview will help streamline the interview scheduling process.

**Communicating decisions with an applicant**

* We believe hiring staff need to indicate if an application has been looked at in order to prevent duplication of tasks.
* We believe not all hiring staff want to provide applicants with details as to why they have not been successful.

**Communicating decisions with an applicant**

* We believe hiring staff communicate with applicants when they need to:
clarify information provided on the application
    * collect references
    * complete the required DBS checks
    * arrange an interview
    * clarify the interview information and details
    * offer a role after an interview
* We believe hiring staff need to keep a record of any communication they make with applicants.

**Making notes on an application**

* We believe hiring staff use note taking as a form of communication amongst those involved in the recruitment process.


## 10 Key takeaways

1. As a whole, we received positive feedback from hiring staff. They were familiar with the features we were offering and were able to interact with them in a way that demonstrated their usability.

Hiring staff commented that TV was ‘useful’, ‘quicker than their current processes’ and ‘would make their lives easier’. Although there is currently a low take up of the application feature, it is clear that what we are offering adds value and is beneficial to hiring staff.

The low take up of our application feature may be influenced by a number of other barriers that may be preventing schools from being able to use it. These include:

    * ties with the trust / LA.
    * ties with the school’s application form.
    * decisions to move away from adopted systems falling on the headteacher.
    * a lack of awareness of TV and the application offering
    * the time and management constraints of adding a new system on top of what they already have.
    * jobseeker awareness and the risk of losing quality candidates

> "I think TV would be great for our school, it's easy..it's sufficient" "it’s quicker than having paper"

2. It is not uncommon for schools to buy into an LA’s personnel team. This means they often become tied to the application form and rules set out by the LA. Similarly, schools that are part of a trust must also comply with the guidelines set out by the trust. This means schools are often tied to mandated application forms and recruitment methods.

In addition to this, schools are reluctant to move away from their own application forms and believe the questions on their form to be important.

This is reflected in the number of schools currently using the application feature. Out of 6560 vacancies that expired between 17 October to 17 November on Teaching Vacancies, only 4.63% offered the TV application form.

As we encounter more and more schools with mandated application forms, we need to consider how to overcome this barrier.

In November 2020 a research study was conducted to understand what schools needed from an application form. In that study, we found, if a form were to be provided for schools to use, it was most important that schools were able to customise it to meet their needs.

If competitors like Tes are offering online applications that are customisable, should we be doing the same?

>"Anyone who worked in the LA used the same form - but now you can put your own logo on it, provided you meet some of their criteria because we buy into their personnel team."

>“The MAT want all the job applications to be the same.”

3. Hiring staff like the idea of using something cheaper over their paid subscriptions but in reality only have a vague idea of their recruitment costs.

As they adopt their systems from previous staff members, there is no real incentive to move away from what seems to work for them even if it is costly. For hiring staff, the priority is to receive quality candidates and act quickly to avoid losing them.

Trying an alternative method comes with a risk and they can’t afford to lose candidates in the process.

>“We have a budget - I've got no idea how much is in it [...] there's always enough for a TES subscription."

>"I don't know what the costs involved are, I've never asked.”

4. The headteacher is most likely to be the one to make decisions on where they advertise, whether they use an applicant tracking system (ATS) or what ATS they use.

We know headteachers and the senior leadership team (SLT) are busy and not always willing to log in to systems like TV. We therefore need to find a way of getting them to understand what is on offer even if they are not the ones that are going to be using it.

How might we expose the service to headteachers and encourage them to make TV a central part of their recruitment strategy?

5.We tested a feature where hiring staff could set up interviews through the service:
