# Design history for Teaching Vacancies

A place for us to document our service designs for the GOV.UK Teaching Vacancies service.

<https://teaching-vacancies-design-history.london.cloudapps.digital/>

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) and the
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator.

It is deployed to [GOV.UK PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/) using Github Actions.
